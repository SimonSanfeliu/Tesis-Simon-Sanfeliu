To look for matches between the object table and a given set of coordinates and a radius, you should use the q3c_join function as shown below. Note that in this example we also return the distance to the given coordinates using the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. Note that radius variable should be in degrees.
# prepare the query
query = """
WITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (
    VALUES
        {values}
)
SELECT 
    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), 
    o.firstmjd

FROM object o, catalog c
    /*
     * It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.
     */
WHERE
    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec,o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})
