Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total.

Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user\'s request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as \'stamp_classifier\'): All alerts related to new objects undergo stamp-based classification.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as \'lc_classifier\'): A balanced hierarchical random forest classifier employing four models and 15 classes.\n- The first hierarchical classifier has three classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as \'lc_classifier_top.\'\n- Three additional classifiers specialize in different spatial object types: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \'lc_classifier_periodic,\' \'lc_classifier_transient,\' and \'lc_classifier_stochastic,\' respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Spatial Object Types by Classifier\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n## DEFAULT CONDITIONS YOU NEED TO SET\n### IF THE \'probability\' TABLE is used, use always the next conditions, unless the user explicitly specifies different probability conditions.\n- \'probability.ranking\' = 1 ; this only return the most likely probabilities.\n- \'probability.classifier_name=\'lc_classifier\' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the ""SELECT *"" SQL statement.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query over \'probability\' or \'object\' if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n\n# Generate a query for each step, resolving and analysing it, with the following format:\n```step_number [STEP QUERY HERE] ```\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON\'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\n""Query the top 200 objects classified SNIa according to the light curve classifier.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to \n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification. If no classifier is specified, use \n  \'classifier_name=""""lc_classifier""""\' when selecting probabilities.\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns, use the ""SELECT"" SQL statement \nto choose all possible columns.\n- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n\n### IF THE \'feature\' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take \nthe following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI.

This will ensure that we only work with relevant objects.\n   - **Sub-query**: \n     ```sql\n     SELECT oid \n     FROM object \n     WHERE oid IN (\'ZTF17aaadpsi\', \'ZTF19aaduncs\', \'ZTF18abnvehl\', \'ZTF19abrqsxy\', \'ZTF19aaduodl\', \'ZTF19aadovdv\', \'ZTF18aammkke\', \'ZTF18abtriul\', \'ZTF17aabwtky\', \'ZTF18abwjpfy\')\n     ```\n\n3. **[Sub-query for Amplitude Feature]**:\n   - Create a subquery to retrieve the \'Amplitude\' feature from the \'feature\' table for the oids obtained in the previous step.\n   - **Sub-query**:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT oid, value AS Amplitude\n     FROM feature\n     WHERE name = \'Amplitude\' AND oid IN (SELECT oid FROM object WHERE oid IN (\'ZTF17aaadpsi\', \'ZTF19aaduncs\', \'ZTF18abnvehl\', \'ZTF19abrqsxy\', \'ZTF19aaduodl\', \'ZTF19aadovdv\', \'ZTF18aammkke\', \'ZTF18abtriul\', \'ZTF17aabwtky\', \'ZTF18abwjpfy\'))\n     ```\n\n4. **[Sub-query for Multiband_period Feature]**:\n   - Create a subquery to retrieve the \'Multiband_period\' feature from the \'feature\' table for the oids obtained in the initial subquery.\n   - **Sub-query**:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT oid, value AS Multiband_period\n     FROM feature\n     WHERE name = \'Multiband_period\' AND oid IN (SELECT oid FROM object WHERE oid IN (\'ZTF17aaadpsi\', \'ZTF19aaduncs\', \'ZTF18abnvehl\', \'ZTF19abrqsxy\', \'ZTF19aaduodl\', \'ZTF19aadovdv\', \'ZTF18aammkke\', \'ZTF18abtriul\', \'ZTF17aabwtky\', \'ZTF18abwjpfy\'))\n     ```\n\n5. **[Union of Feature Queries]**:\n   - Use a UNION operation to combine the results of the \'Amplitude\' and \'Multiband_period\' subqueries. This will ensure that we get all relevant features for the specified oids.\n   - **Union Query**:\n     ```sql\n     (SELECT oid, value AS Feature_Value, \'Amplitude\' AS Feature_Name\n      FROM feature\n      WHERE name = \'Amplitude\' AND oid IN (SELECT oid FROM object WHERE oid IN (\'ZTF17aaadpsi\', \'ZTF19aaduncs\', \'ZTF18abnvehl\', \'ZTF19abrqsxy\', \'ZTF19aaduodl\', \'ZTF19aadovdv\', \'ZTF18aammkke\', \'ZTF18abtriul\', \'ZTF17aabwtky\', \'ZTF18abwjpfy\')))\n     UNION\n     (SELECT oid, value AS Feature_Value, \'Multiband_period\' AS Feature_Name\n      FROM feature\n      WHERE name = \'Multiband_period\' AND oid IN (SELECT oid FROM object WHERE oid IN (\'ZTF17aaadpsi\', \'ZTF19aaduncs\', \'ZTF18abnvehl\', \'ZTF19abrqsxy\', \'ZTF19aaduodl\', \'ZTF19aadovdv\', \'ZTF18aammkke\', \'ZTF18abtriul\', \'ZTF17aabwtky\', \'ZTF18abwjpfy\')))\n     ```\n\n6. **[Final Query Construction]**:\n   - Construct the final query by selecting the necessary columns from the union of the feature queries.\n   - Ensure that the query is optimized by using indexed columns and avoiding unnecessary joins.\n   - **Final Query**:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT oid, Feature_Name, Feature_Value\n     FROM (\n       (SELECT oid, value AS Feature_Value, \'Amplitude\' AS Feature_Name\n        FROM feature\n        WHERE name = \'Amplitude\' AND oid IN (SELECT oid FROM object WHERE oid IN (\'ZTF17aaadpsi\', \'ZTF19aaduncs\', \'ZTF18abnvehl\', \'ZTF19abrqsxy\', \'ZTF19aaduodl\', \'ZTF19aadovdv\', \'ZTF18aammkke\', \'ZTF18abtriul\', \'ZTF17aabwtky\', \'ZTF18abwjpfy\')))\n       UNION\n       (SELECT oid, value AS Feature_Value, \'Multiband_period\' AS Feature_Name\n        FROM feature\n        WHERE name = \'Multiband_period\' AND oid IN (SELECT oid FROM object WHERE oid IN (\'ZTF17aaadpsi\', \'ZTF19aaduncs\', \'ZTF18abnvehl\', \'ZTF19abrqsxy\', \'ZTF19aaduodl\', \'ZTF19aadovdv\', \'ZTF18aammkke\', \'ZTF18abtriul\', \'ZTF17aabwtky\', \'ZTF18abwjpfy\')))\n     ) AS feature_union\n     ```\n\n7. **[Comments and Documentation]**:\n   - Add comments to the query to explain each step and the purpose of each subquery and operation. This will help users understand the logic and flow of the query.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the query is efficient and adheres to the guidelines provided, especially regarding the use of indexed variables and the avoidance of unnecessary joins.\n\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For \nexample, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.', 'Self-correction': '\nAs a SQL expert with a willingness to assist users, you are tasked with crafting a PostgreSQL query for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Database in 2023.

The query must return the columns oid, meanra, meandec, ndet, firstMJD, class name and probability.\nTables needed: [\'object\', \'detection\', \'probability\', \'taxonomy\']\n\n# General context about the database:\n## General Information about the Schema and Database\n- An object is uniquely identified by its object identifier or \'oid\' index, \nused in most tables\n- A detection from an object is identified by the candidate identifier or \n\'candid\' index, used only in the detection table\n- A given band is identified by the filter identifier or \'fid\' index, used in \nthe magstats, feature, and detection tables\n- In most cases you will need to use information from the object table\n- When particular astronomical classes are requested, you will need to use the \nprobability table \n- Prioritize obtaining oids in a subquery to optimize the main query.\n- Utilize nested queries to retrieve oids, preferably selecting the \n\'probability\' or \'object\' table.\n- Avoid JOIN clauses; instead, favor nested queries.\n- Beware of variables that are not indexed when doing the queries. Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to \n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification. If no classifier is specified, use \n  \'classifier_name=""""lc_classifier""""\' when selecting probabilities.\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns, use the ""SELECT"" SQL statement \nto choose all possible columns.\n- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n\n### IF THE \'feature\' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take \nthe following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI.

The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry).

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy.

This database serves as a \nrepository for information about astronomical variable objects. The information \nfor every variable object originates from a sequence of one or more \nastronomical alerts, data packets streamed when an astronomical object shows a \nsignificant variation with respect to a reference image. The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry). Your role \ninvolves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the \ngiven tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by \nthe user and always maintain awareness of the broader context. Be thorough in \nunderstanding and addressing the user\'s request, taking into account both \nexplicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\nUser request: Which objects were found between June 1st and July 1st of 2018 by the light curve classifier?\nTables needed: [\'object\', \'probability\']\n\n# General context about the database:\n## General Information about the Schema and Database\n- An object is uniquely identified by its object identifier or \'oid\' index, \nused in most tables\n- A detection from an object is identified by the candidate identifier or \n\'candid\' index, used only in the detection table\n- A given band is identified by the filter identifier or \'fid\' index, used in \nthe magstats, feature, and detection tables\n- In most cases you will need to use information from the object table\n- When particular astronomical classes are requested, you will need to use the \nprobability table \n- Prioritize obtaining oids in a subquery to optimize the main query.\n- Utilize nested queries to retrieve oids, preferably selecting the \n\'probability\' or \'object\' table.\n- Avoid JOIN clauses; instead, favor nested queries.\n- Beware of variables that are not indexed when doing the queries. Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total.

Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification. If no classifier is specified, use \n  \'classifier_name=""""lc_classifier""""\' when selecting probabilities.\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns, use the ""SELECT"" SQL statement \nto choose all possible columns.\n- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n\n# Answer ONLY with a SQL query, with the following format: \n```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\n\nDON\'T include anything else in your answer.', 'Self-correction': '\nAs a SQL expert with a willingness to assist users, you are tasked with crafting a PostgreSQL query for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Database in 2023.

The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry). Your role \ninvolves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the \ngiven tables.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total.

Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification. If no classifier is specified, use \n  \'classifier_name=""""lc_classifier""""\' when selecting probabilities.\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns, use the ""SELECT"" SQL statement \nto choose all possible columns.\n- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n\n# Answer ONLY with a SQL query, with the following format: \n```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\n\nDON\'T include anything else in your answer.', 'Self-correction': '\nAs a SQL expert with a willingness to assist users, you are tasked with crafting a PostgreSQL query for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Database in 2023.

This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier.

Here is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **[Initial Planning]**: \n   - Identify the main objective: Retrieve r-band epochs for specific ZTF objects from the \'dataquality\' table.\n   - Determine the necessary columns to return: ZTF and candidate identifiers, x- and y-image positions, and peak-pixel S/N.\n\n2. **[Sub-query for OIDs]**:\n   - Use a sub-query to retrieve the object identifiers (oids) for the given ZTF identifiers (\'ZTF20acwrybw\' and \'ZTF22abugigx\') from the \'object\' table.\n   - This step is crucial to optimize the main query by filtering the data based on indexed columns.\n\n3. **[Condition for Filter ID]**:\n   - Identify the filter identifier (fid) for the r-band. According to the context, fid is used to specify the band in various tables.\n   - Ensure that the query filters data for the r-band by using the appropriate fid value.\n\n4. **[Main Query Construction]**:\n   - Construct the main query to retrieve data from the \'dataquality\' table.\n   - Use the oids obtained from the sub-query to filter the data.\n   - Apply the condition for the r-band using the fid value.\n\n5. **[Select Columns]**:\n   - Specify the columns to be selected in the main query: ZTF identifier (oid), candidate identifier (candid), x-image position, y-image position, and peak-pixel S/N.\n   - Ensure that these columns are correctly referenced from the \'dataquality\' table.\n\n6. **[Sub-query Integration]**:\n   - Integrate the sub-query for oids into the WHERE clause of the main query.\n   - Use the condition ""WHERE oid IN {sub-query}"" to filter the data based on the retrieved oids.\n\n7. **[Final Query Optimization]**:\n   - Review the query structure to ensure it avoids unnecessary joins and uses indexed columns effectively.\n   - Ensure that the query execution time is optimized by prioritizing sub-queries and filtering conditions.\n\n8. **[Comments for Clarity]**:\n   - Add PostgreSQL-style comments to the query to explain each step and the purpose of the conditions used.\n   - This will help users understand the logic and flow of the query.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that efficiently retrieves the required information from the ALeRCE database while adhering to the given constraints and context.\n\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry). Your role \ninvolves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the \ngiven tables.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table.

The user wants to find the number of rows in the \'dataquality\' table with a minimum reduced chi-square value of 5 for objects with specific ZTF identifiers (\'ZTF23abjikaf\' and \'ZTF20achlced\'). The relevant tables are \'object\' and \'dataquality\'.\n\n2. **[Sub-query]**: Create a sub-query to retrieve the \'oid\' (object identifier) for the specified ZTF identifiers from the \'object\' table. This step is crucial because the \'oid\' is used to link the \'object\' and \'dataquality\' tables.\n   - **Columns**: oid\n   - **Table**: object\n   - **Condition**: WHERE the ZTF identifier is in (\'ZTF23abjikaf\', \'ZTF20achlced\').\n\n3. **[Condition]**: Use the sub-query from step 2 to filter the \'dataquality\' table. The goal is to select rows where the \'oid\' matches those retrieved in the sub-query.\n   - **Columns**: oid, chipsf (reduced chi-square for PSF-fit)\n   - **Table**: dataquality\n   - **Condition**: WHERE oid is in the list of oids from the sub-query.\n\n4. **[Condition]**: Add an additional condition to filter rows in the \'dataquality\' table where the \'chipsf\' (reduced chi-square for PSF-fit) is greater than or equal to 5.\n\n5. **[Aggregation]**: Count the number of rows that meet the conditions specified in steps 3 and 4.

The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry). Your role \ninvolves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the \ngiven tables.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier.

The goal is to find the MPC name and MPC magnitude of the nearest known Solar System object for the ZTF object \'ZTF21acitntz\'. We will return the ZTF object identifier, the MPC name, and the MPC magnitude. Here is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **[Initial Planning]**: \n   - Identify the main objective: Retrieve the MPC name and MPC magnitude of the nearest known Solar System object for the ZTF object \'ZTF21acitntz\'.\n   - Determine the tables involved: \'object\' and \'ss_ztf\'.\n\n2. **[Sub-query]**: \n   - Create a sub-query to select the \'oid\' of the ZTF object \'ZTF21acitntz\' from the \'object\' table. This will help in filtering the relevant data in the main query.\n   - **Sub-query**: \n     ```sql\n     SELECT oid \n     FROM object \n     WHERE object.oid = \'ZTF21acitntz\'\n     ```\n\n3. **[Condition]**: \n   - Use the \'oid\' obtained from the sub-query to filter the \'ss_ztf\' table. This table contains information about Solar System objects associated with ZTF objects.\n\n4. **[Sub-query]**: \n   - Create a sub-query to select the nearest Solar System object for the given \'oid\'. This involves finding the minimum distance (ssdistnr) from the \'ss_ztf\' table.\n   - **Sub-query**: \n     ```sql\n     SELECT ssnamenr, ssmagnr \n     FROM ss_ztf \n     WHERE oid = (SELECT oid FROM object WHERE oid = \'ZTF21acitntz\') \n     ORDER BY ssdistnr ASC \n     LIMIT 1\n     ```\n\n5. **[Final Query]**: \n   - Combine the results to form the final query. The final query should return the ZTF object identifier, the MPC name, and the MPC magnitude.\n   - Ensure that the query is optimized by using indexed columns and avoiding unnecessary joins.\n\n6. **[Output]**: \n   - The final output should include the ZTF object identifier (\'ZTF21acitntz\'), the MPC name, and the MPC magnitude of the nearest Solar System object.\n\n7. **[Comments]**: \n   - Add comments in PostgreSQL format to explain each part of the query for clarity and understanding.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the query is efficient and retrieves the necessary information from the ALeRCE database. The use of sub-queries helps in optimizing the query by leveraging indexed columns and minimizing the use of joins.\n\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier.

The user wants to retrieve the ZTF object identifier and the distance from its catalog counterpart for objects with a specific identifier in the ALLWISE catalog. The relevant tables are `xmatch` and `allwise`.\n\n2. **[Sub-query]**: Create a sub-query to select the `oid_catalog` from the `allwise` table where the `oid_catalog` matches the specified identifier \'J163603.54-065228.7\'. This sub-query will help filter the relevant objects in the `xmatch` table.\n   - **Sub-query**: \n     ```sql\n     SELECT oid_catalog\n     FROM allwise\n     WHERE oid_catalog = \'J163603.54-065228.7\'\n     ```\n\n3. **[Sub-query]**: Use the result of the previous sub-query to filter the `xmatch` table. Select the `oid` (ZTF object identifier) and the `distance` from the `xmatch` table where the `oid_catalog` is in the result of the sub-query.\n   - **Sub-query**:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT oid, distance\n     FROM xmatch\n     WHERE oid_catalog IN (SELECT oid_catalog FROM allwise WHERE oid_catalog = \'J163603.54-065228.7\')\n     ```\n\n4. **[Condition]**: Ensure that the query is optimized by using indexed columns. The `oid`, `catid`, and `oid_catalog` in the `xmatch` table are indexed, which should help in optimizing the query performance.\n\n5. **[Final Query Construction]**: Construct the final query by combining the sub-queries. The final query should retrieve the ZTF object identifier and the distance from the catalog counterpart for the specified ALLWISE object identifier.\n\n6. **[Commenting]**: Add comments to the query to explain each part of the process. This will help users understand the logic behind the query construction.\n\n7. **[Review and Optimization]**: Review the query to ensure it adheres to the guidelines provided, such as avoiding unnecessary joins and using nested queries effectively. Ensure that the query is efficient and does not exceed the typical timeout time of 2 minutes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that retrieves the requested information from the ALeRCE database while adhering to the provided guidelines and optimizing for performance.\n\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user\'s request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as \'stamp_classifier\'): All alerts related to new objects undergo stamp-based classification.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as \'lc_classifier\'): A balanced hierarchical random forest classifier employing four models and 15 classes.\n- The first hierarchical classifier has three classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as \'lc_classifier_top.\'\n- Three additional classifiers specialize in different spatial object types: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \'lc_classifier_periodic,\' \'lc_classifier_transient,\' and \'lc_classifier_stochastic,\' respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Spatial Object Types by Classifier\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n## DEFAULT CONDITIONS YOU NEED TO SET\n### IF THE \'probability\' TABLE is used, use always the next conditions, unless the user explicitly specifies different probability conditions.\n- \'probability.ranking\' = 1 ; this only return the most likely probabilities.\n- \'probability.classifier_name=\'lc_classifier\' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the ""SELECT *"" SQL statement.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query over \'probability\' or \'object\' if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n\n# Generate a query for each step, resolving and analysing it, with the following format:\n```step_number [STEP QUERY HERE] ```\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON\'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\nFor objects with ZTF identifiers \'ZTF21abstkhj\', \'ZTF22aacqjeb\' and \'ZTF21aamwpdf\', find all rows in the \'ps1_ztf\' table that have a star/galaxy score of the nearest source that is lower than 0.2\n\n# This are the tables Schema.

The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry). Your role \ninvolves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the \ngiven tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by \nthe user and always maintain awareness of the broader context. Be thorough in \nunderstanding and addressing the user\'s request, taking into account both \nexplicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\nUser request: Find at most 30 rows in the \'magstat\' table that have a minimum number of detections of 10, median difference magnitude fainter than 19, and last difference magnitude brighter than 17.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier.

The goal is to find all rows in the \'reference\' table for objects with specific ZTF identifiers that have information in the g band, and return specific columns sorted by ZTF identifier. Here is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **[Initial Planning]**: \n   - Identify the main task: Retrieve information from the \'reference\' table for specific ZTF identifiers.\n   - Determine the specific ZTF identifiers: \'ZTF20aczxeud\', \'ZTF21aappfdu\', \'ZTF22aacqjeb\'.\n   - Identify the required columns: reference identifier, ZTF identifier, candidate identifier, magnitude, and its uncertainty.\n   - Note the sorting requirement: Sort results by ZTF identifier.\n\n2. **[Sub-query for OIDs]**:\n   - Create a sub-query to retrieve the \'oid\' (object identifier) for the specified ZTF identifiers from the \'object\' table.\n   - This sub-query will optimize the main query by filtering the relevant objects early.\n\n3. **[Condition for Filter ID]**:\n   - Determine the filter ID for the g band. This is typically a known constant in the database schema (e.g., fid=1 for g band).\n   - This condition will be used to filter the \'reference\' table for entries in the g band.\n\n4. **[Main Query Construction]**:\n   - Construct the main query to select the required columns from the \'reference\' table.\n   - Use a WHERE clause to filter the \'reference\' table based on the \'oid\' values obtained from the sub-query and the filter ID for the g band.\n\n5. **[Sorting]**:\n   - Add an ORDER BY clause to sort the results by the ZTF identifier.\n\n6. **[Final Query Assembly]**:\n   - Assemble the final query by integrating the sub-query and main query components.\n   - Ensure that the query is structured to avoid unnecessary joins and prioritize the use of indexed columns.\n\n7. **[Comments for Clarity]**:\n   - Add comments in PostgreSQL format to explain each part of the query for user understanding.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a query that efficiently retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database while adhering to the constraints and optimizations outlined in the general context.\n\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification. If no classifier is specified, use \n  \'classifier_name=""""lc_classifier""""\' when selecting probabilities.\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns, use the ""SELECT"" SQL statement to choose all possible columns.\n- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over \'probability\' or \'object\' if it is necessary (in this order).\n# Add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# DON\'T RETURN ANY SQL CODE, just the description of each step required to generate it.', 'Query generation': '# As a SQL expert with a willingness to assist users, you are tasked with \ncrafting a PostgreSQL query for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid \nClassification of Events (ALeRCE) database. This database serves as a \nrepository for information about astronomical variable objects. The information \nfor every variable object originates from a sequence of one or more \nastronomical alerts, data packets streamed when an astronomical object shows \na significant variation with respect to a reference image. The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object. The tables within the database are \ncategorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object and \nprobability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent \n(e.g., detection, forced-photometry). Your role involves carefully analyzing \nuser requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to \npay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain \nawareness of the broader context. Be thorough in understanding and addressing \nthe user\'s request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the \noverall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\nUser request: For objects with ZTF identifiers \'ZTF18acxlskz\', \'ZTF22aanppbi\' and \'ZTF22abunrft\', find all rows in the \'gaia_ztf\' table where the nearest Gaia source lies within 1.5 arcsec of the ZTF object detection\nTables needed: [\'object\', \'gaia_ztf\']\n\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to \n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier.

The ZTF identifiers provided are \'ZTF18acxlskz\', \'ZTF22aanppbi\', and \'ZTF22abunrft\'.\n\n2. **[Sub-query]**: Create a sub-query to retrieve the \'oid\' values for the specified ZTF identifiers from the \'object\' table. This step is crucial because the \'oid\' is the unique identifier used in most tables, including \'gaia_ztf\'.\n\n   - **Sub-task**: Use a `SELECT` statement to get the \'oid\' from the \'object\' table where the \'oid\' matches any of the specified ZTF identifiers.\n\n3. **[Condition]**: Define the condition for the spatial proximity between the ZTF object detections and the nearest Gaia source. The condition is that the distance should be within 1.5 arcsec.\n\n   - **Sub-task**: Use the `q3c_join` function to perform a spatial query. This function will help in finding matches between the \'object\' table and the \'gaia_ztf\' table based on the specified radius (1.5 arcsec, converted to degrees).\n\n4. **[Sub-query]**: Construct a sub-query to filter the \'gaia_ztf\' table using the \'oid\' values obtained from the previous sub-query. This sub-query will ensure that only the relevant rows from \'gaia_ztf\' are considered.\n\n   - **Sub-task**: Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve all columns from the \'gaia_ztf\' table where the \'oid\' is in the list of \'oid\' values obtained from the first sub-query.\n\n5. **[Join]**: Although the use of `JOIN` is generally discouraged, in this case, a logical connection between the \'object\' and \'gaia_ztf\' tables is necessary to apply the spatial condition.\n\n   - **Sub-task**: Use the `q3c_join` function to join the \'object\' table and the \'gaia_ztf\' table based on the spatial condition. Ensure that the \'meanra\' and \'meandec\' from the \'object\' table are used in conjunction with the \'neargaia\' from the \'gaia_ztf\' table.\n\n6. **[Final Query Construction]**: Assemble the final query by combining the sub-queries and conditions.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy.

This database serves as a \nrepository for information about astronomical variable objects. The information \nfor every variable object originates from a sequence of one or more \nastronomical alerts, data packets streamed when an astronomical object shows a \nsignificant variation with respect to a reference image. The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry). Your role \ninvolves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the \ngiven tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by \nthe user and always maintain awareness of the broader context. Be thorough in \nunderstanding and addressing the user\'s request, taking into account both \nexplicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\nUser request: For the ZTF object \'ZTF20achscch\', get the following columns from the \'xmatch\' table: catalog name, object identifier in the catalog, and distance from the catalog counterpart\nTables needed: [\'xmatch\']\n\n# General context about the database:\n## General Information about the Schema and Database\n- An object is uniquely identified by its object identifier or \'oid\' index, \nused in most tables\n- A detection from an object is identified by the candidate identifier or \n\'candid\' index, used only in the detection table\n- A given band is identified by the filter identifier or \'fid\' index, used in \nthe magstats, feature, and detection tables\n- In most cases you will need to use information from the object table\n- When particular astronomical classes are requested, you will need to use the \nprobability table \n- Prioritize obtaining oids in a subquery to optimize the main query.\n- Utilize nested queries to retrieve oids, preferably selecting the \n\'probability\' or \'object\' table.\n- Avoid JOIN clauses; instead, favor nested queries.\n- Beware of variables that are not indexed when doing the queries. Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy.

List the steps in the order in which they should be planned. Add to each numbered step a label in square brackets, like [initial planning], [join table], [replace], [condition], [join], [sub-query], etc. The request is a very difficult and advanced query, so you will need to use JOINs, INTERSECTs and UNIONs statements, together with Nested queries. It is very important that you give every possible detail in each step, describing the statements and the nested-queries that are required.\n\nUser request: Find all epochs in the \'forced_photometry\' table of the ZTF object \'ZTF24aaiutyh\'. Return the following columns sort by date: object identifier, date, filter identifier, difference magnitude and its uncertainty, corrected magnitude and its uncertainty, and isdiffpos flag\nTables needed: [\'detection\']\n\n# General context about the database:\n## General Information about the Schema and Database\n- An object is uniquely identified by its object identifier or \'oid\' index, \nused in most tables\n- A detection from an object is identified by the candidate identifier or \n\'candid\' index, used only in the detection table\n- A given band is identified by the filter identifier or \'fid\' index, used in \nthe magstats, feature, and detection tables\n- In most cases you will need to use information from the object table\n- When particular astronomical classes are requested, you will need to use the \nprobability table \n- Prioritize obtaining oids in a subquery to optimize the main query.\n- Utilize nested queries to retrieve oids, preferably selecting the \n\'probability\' or \'object\' table.\n- Avoid JOIN clauses; instead, favor nested queries.\n- Beware of variables that are not indexed when doing the queries. Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to \n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification. If no classifier is specified, use \n  \'classifier_name=""""lc_classifier""""\' when selecting probabilities.\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns, use the ""SELECT"" SQL statement \nto choose all possible columns.\n- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n\n### IF THE \'feature\' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take \nthe following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI.

The database \ninformation includes flux variations as a function of time (known as light \ncurve), basic object properties such as the coordinates, and advanced features \nor statistics computed for each object.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band \nindependent (e.g., object and probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), \nand time and band-dependent (e.g., detection, forced-photometry).

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier.

The goal is to retrieve specific information about ZTF objects from the ALeRCE database, focusing on objects with certain ZTF identifiers and conditions. Here is a detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **[Initial Planning]**: Identify the main objective of the query.\n   - We need to retrieve information about ZTF objects with specific identifiers where the corrected light curve was not computed.\n   - The required columns are: ZTF identifier, number of detections, mean RA Dec coordinates, dates of first and last detections, difference between mean g- and r-band difference magnitudes, and difference between mean g- and r-band corrected magnitudes.\n\n2. **[Sub-query]**: Create a sub-query to filter objects by ZTF identifiers.\n   - Use the `object` table to filter objects with the given ZTF identifiers: \'ZTF20abywydb\', \'ZTF20abzpxxu\', and \'ZTF20acduffd\'.\n   - This sub-query will return the `oid` for these objects.\n\n3. **[Condition]**: Determine the condition for ""corrected light curve was not computed.""\n   - This condition implies that the corrected magnitudes (magpsf_corr) are not available or not computed.\n   - We need to check the `detection` table for the absence of corrected magnitudes for these objects.\n\n4. **[Sub-query]**: Create a sub-query to identify objects without corrected light curves.\n   - Use the `detection` table to check for the absence of `magpsf_corr` values for the filtered `oid` from the previous step.\n   - This sub-query will return `oid` where `magpsf_corr` is NULL or not present.\n\n5. **[Main Query]**: Construct the main query to retrieve the required columns.\n   - Use the `object` table to select the required columns: ZTF identifier (`oid`), number of detections (`ndet`), mean RA Dec coordinates (`meanra`, `meandec`), dates of first and last detections (`firstmjd`, `lastmjd`).\n   - Calculate the difference between mean g- and r-band difference magnitudes and corrected magnitudes using the `detection` table.\n   - Ensure that the `oid` is in the list returned by the sub-query from step 4.\n\n6. **[Calculation]**: Calculate the differences in magnitudes.\n   - Use the `detection` table to calculate the difference between mean g- and r-band difference magnitudes and corrected magnitudes.\n   - This involves aggregating the magnitudes by `fid` (filter identifier) and computing the differences.\n\n7. **[Sorting]**: Sort the results by the first detection date.\n   - Use the `firstmjd` column from the `object` table to sort the results in ascending order.\n\n8. **[Final Query Construction]**: Assemble the final query.\n   - Combine all the steps to form the final query, ensuring that all conditions and calculations are correctly applied.\n   - Use comments to explain each part of the query for clarity.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, adhering to the specified conditions and requirements.\n\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to \n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table.

The query should return the ZTF identifier, feature name and value, filter identifier, and feature version, sorted by ZTF identifier, filter identifier, and feature version. Here is a detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **[Initial Planning]**: \n   - Identify the main tables involved: `object`, `feature`, and `feature_version`.\n   - Determine the primary key relationships: `oid` is the primary key in the `object` table and is used in the `feature` table.\n   - Note that the `feature` table is transposed, meaning each feature is in a different row, which requires special handling.\n\n2. **[Sub-query for Object Identification]**:\n   - Create a sub-query to retrieve the `oid` for the object with the ZTF identifier \'ZTF18abqyaix\' from the `object` table.\n   - This sub-query will be used to filter the `feature` table to only include rows related to this specific object.\n\n3. **[Sub-query for Feature Retrieval]**:\n   - For each feature, create a sub-query to retrieve the specific feature\'s name and value from the `feature` table.\n   - Use the `oid` obtained from the previous sub-query to filter the features related to the object \'ZTF18abqyaix\'.\n   - Ensure that the sub-query includes the `filter identifier` (`fid`) and `feature version` from the `feature_version` table.\n\n4. **[Union and Intersect Handling]**:\n   - Since the `feature` table is transposed, create separate sub-queries for each feature of interest.\n   - Use `UNION` to combine the results of these sub-queries, ensuring that all features for the object are included.\n   - Use `INTERSECT` if there are conditions that require the presence of multiple features simultaneously.\n\n5. **[Join with Feature Version]**:\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the results of the `UNION` query and the `feature_version` table to include the `feature version` in the final result.\n   - Ensure that the join condition is based on the appropriate keys, such as `feature_id` or another relevant identifier.\n\n6. **[Final Filtering and Sorting]**:\n   - Apply any additional filtering conditions, such as specific `filter identifiers` or `feature versions`, if required.\n   - Sort the final result by `ZTF identifier`, `filter identifier`, and `feature version` to meet the user\'s request.\n\n7. **[Comments and Documentation]**:\n   - Add comments in PostgreSQL format to explain each step of the query, making it easier for users to understand the logic and flow of the query.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically construct a complex query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database while adhering to the constraints and recommendations provided.\n\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For \nexample, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.', 'Self-correction': '\nAs a SQL expert with a willingness to assist users, you are tasked with crafting a PostgreSQL query for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Database in 2023.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of \n  every object.\n- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as """"lc_classifier""""): A balanced \n  hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and \n  that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This \n  classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six \n  detections in a given band.\n- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three \n  classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as """"lc_classifier_top.""""\n- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in \n  different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as \n  """"lc_classifier_periodic,"""" """"lc_classifier_transient,"""" and \n  """"lc_classifier_stochastic,"""" respectively.\n- The 15 classes are separated for each object type:\n  - Transient: [SNe Ia (\'SNIa\'), SNe Ib/c (\'SNIbc\'), SNe II (\'SNII\'), and Super \n    Luminous SNe (\'SLSN\')].\n  - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei (\'AGN\'), Quasi Stellar Object (\'QSO\'), \n    \'Blazar\', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae (\'CV/Nova\'), and Young Stellar Object \n    (\'YSO\')].\n  - Periodic: [Delta Scuti (\'DSCT\'), RR Lyrae (\'RRL\'), Cepheid (\'Ceph\'), Long \n    Period Variable (\'LPV\'), Eclipsing Binary (\'E\'), and other periodic objects \n    (\'Periodic-Other\')].\n## Probability Variable Names\n- classifier_name=(\'lc_classifier\', \'lc_classifier_top\', \n  \'lc_classifier_transient\', \'lc_classifier_stochastic\', \n  \'lc_classifier_periodic\', \'stamp_classifier\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\', \'QSO\', \'AGN\', \n  \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\', \'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_top\'= (\'transient\', \'stochastic\', \'periodic\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_transient\'= (\'SNIa\', \'SNIbc\', \'SNII\', \'SLSN\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_stochastic\'= (\'QSO\', \'AGN\', \'Blazar\', \'CV/Nova\', \'YSO\')\n- Classes in \'lc_classifier_periodic\'= (\'LPV\', \'E\', \'DSCT\', \'RRL\', \'CEP\', \'Periodic-Other\')\n- Classes in \'stamp_classifier\'= (\'SN\', \'AGN\', \'VS\', \'asteroid\', \'bogus\')\n\n## Astronomical context:\n\n### Types of objects:\n- There are two main types of variable objects: those that have persistent variability and those that have a transient nature. \n- In the case of transient sources (Transient), the relevant light curve is the uncorrected magnitude (magpsf) and its error (sigmapsf).\n- In the case of persistent variability sources (Periodic or Stochastic), the relevant light curve magnitude is the corrected magnitude (magpsf_corr) and its error (sigmapsf_corr for periodic sources and sigmapsf_corr_ext for stochastic sources). \n\n### Definitions:\n- The initial rise rate is indicated by the dmdt_first column in the magstat table, separated by band. You need to use the filter id (fid) column to specify the given band.\n- If the user requests an initial rise rate greater than some value, what they mean is that the rise rate should be less than the negative of that value, because in astronomy magnitudes are lower for brighter objects, so when an object is rising its magnitudes are decreasing.\n- Objects that are transient are considered to be fast risers if dmdt_first < -0.25 mag per day (in the table magstat) in any band. \n\n### Restriction on dates or times:\n- When the user refers to the first detection of a given object, you should use the firstmjd column (indexed in the table object). \n- When possible, avoid adding restrictions on the mjd column in the detection table, try putting them in the object table instead.\n- All the rows in the detection table are by definition detections. this in not the case for the table forced_photometry, where even measurements that are not considered to be detections are reported. \n- You need to convert dates (if given) into mjd before doing any query.\n- If the year is not specified, assume that the user refers to the current year (2024).\n\n### Nested subqueries vs inner joins:\n- In general, if you need to query data from the detection and feature table, it is recommended to use nested subqueries that do the filtering with information not contained in the detection or feature table first, using the WHERE statement and requesting the oid column to be inside a given list. For example, use WHERE oid in {subquery}, where subquery returns a list of oids.\n- However, sometimes it is necessary to use an INNER JOIN between tables to get all the requested columns. When this happens, make sure to use the inner join clause when it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.\n\n### Samples of objects:\n- If you are asked to provide a sample of a given set of objects, you can use the LIMIT command. If you do this, it will be more feasible to do multiple inner joins in some cases.\n- When you are asked to find \'at most\' a number of examples, use the \'LIMIT {n}\' command in SQL, where n is the number of examples.\n\n### Object table:\n- The number of detections is contained in the ndet variable located in the object table.\n\n### Probability table:\n- Use the ranking=1 column in the probability table to get the highest probability class (for a given classifier and classifier_version).\n- The probability table has the column ""classifier_version"", that indicates the version of the classifier used. Use this column to specifiy the version of the classifier for the particular query.\n- If you are querying the probability table to get a list of oids, and if you want to get only one result for a given classifier, irrespective of the version of the classifier, use the DISTINCT command, e.g. \'SELECT DISTINCT oid\'. However, it is preferable that the version of the classifier is specified. \n- If you want to check that an object is periodic, you could check whether the probability of being in the periodic branch (lc_classifier_periodic) has the largest value (ranking=1).\n- Keep in mind that sometimes the concept of probability is referred to as a ""posibility"" by some users.\n\n### feature table\n- You should avoid using the feature table as much as possible, since it is generally very expensive to query data from it.\n- For example, avoid using the feature (or detection) table to get the time of first detection, use the firstmjd column from the object table instead.\n- If you do want to select objects based on restrictions on the feature table, we recommend that you use nested subqueries, where the innermost query defines the sample based on restrictions in the feature or other tables, and where the \nupper levels do inner joins between the different tables and select the necessary columns. \n- The galactic latitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'gal_b\'.\n- The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF for a given band is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'delta_mag_fid\'.\n- The light curve (photometric) period is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Multiband_period\'.\n- The light curve amplitude is in the value column of the feature table, for name=\'Amplitude\'.\n\n### detection table:\n- Every detection in the detection table has a unique candidate identifier (indexed column candid)\n- When asked for magnitude errors, the user is referring to the columns sigmapsf_corr and sigmapsf_corr_ext from the detection table.\n\n### dataquality table:\n- The dataquality table contains information related to the quality of every detection in the database. It has information for every object (with index oid) and candidate detection (with index candid) that is not available in the detection table. \n- Some of the most relevant columns are the reduced chi-square for PSF-fit (chipsf), the full width half maximum (fwhm), the star galaxy \nclassification score from SEXtractor (classtar), and the magnitude zero point estimate and its error (magzpsci, magzpunc).\n\n### forced_photometry table:\n- the forced photometry tables contains light curve measurements for all detected objects even when they didn\'t trigger a detection, but only from December 2023. \n\n### non_detection table:\n- the non detection table contains upper limits for the absolute difference with respect to the reference when no detections were triggered in objects that have associated alerts. \n\n### PanSTARRS (PS1) and the ps1_ztf table:\n- The ps1_ztf table contains information about the closest sources in the PanSTARRS catalog. \n- Variables ending in 1 refer to the closest object, variables ending in 2 refer to the second closest object, and variables ending in 3 refer to third closest object. For example, the variables associated to these closest PS1 objects from a given ZTF object are sgscore1, which is the star galaxy classication score; distpsnr1, which is the distance to the source; sgmag1, srmag1, simag1, szmag1 which are \nthe magnitudes in the g, r, i, and z bands, respectively; and objectidps1, which is the PanSTARRS unique identifier of the object.\n\n### gaia_ztf:\n- Objects have information about the nearest objects in the Gaia catalog in the gaia_ztf table.\n- The key quantities are the distance to the closest gaia source irrespective of magnitude (neargaia) and the magnitude of the closest source (maggaia). \n\n### ss_ztf:\n- Objects that have Solar System counterparts (asteroids or moving objects) have this information stored in the ss_ztf table.\n- The key quantities for a given oid and candid are the distance to the nearest known Solar System object in arcsec (ssdistnr), its magnitude (ssmagnr), and its name (ssnamenr).\n\n### allwise table:\n- We keep a copy of the allwise catalog objects that are found when crossmatching ZTF objects against Allwise in the allwise table.\n- The key quantities are the name of the object in the allwise catalog (oid_catalog), its right ascension and declination (ra and dec), and the W1 to W4 magnitudes (w1mpro to w4mpro) and errors (w1sigmpro to w4sigmpro) \n\n### xmatch table:\n- The xmatch table has three identifiers that are indexed columns: oid, which corresponds to the unique ZTF identifier; catid, which corresponds to the catalog identifier; and oid_catalog, which is the unique identifier for a given source in the catalog nomenclature. \n- If you want to associate objects in xmatch with one of the available xmatch catalogs, e.g. allwise, you should first do an inner join between xmatch and allwise using the oid_catalog identifier. \n- If you want to restrict the query to some objects based on other properties, you should use two nested queries that first select the oid_catalog identifiers and a second innermost query that uses the oid column to apply additional restrictions, e.g.\n```python\ninnermostquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n    oid\nFROM\n    object\nWHERE\n    ndet>1\n\'\'\'\nsubquery = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   oid_catalog\nFROM\n   xmatch\nWHERE\n   oid IN {innermostquery}\n\'\'\'\nfinal_query = \'\'\'\nSELECT\n   *\nFROM\n   xmatch INNER JOIN allwise\n   ON xmatch.oid_catalog=allwise.oid_catalog\nWHERE\n   allwise.oid_catalog IN {subquery}\n\'\'\'\n```\n\n### Spatial queries: \nTo look for matches between the object table and a set of coordinates given a crossmatch radius, you can use the q3c_join function as shown below:\n```python\n# Prepare the query\nquery = \'\'\'\n-- ids and coordinates of the catalog against which we want to crossmatch\nWITH catalog ( source_id, ra, dec) AS (\n    VALUES\n        {values}\n)\nSELECT \n    c.source_id, c.ra, c.dec, o.oid, o.meanra, o.meandec, q3c_dist(c.ra,c.dec,o.meanra,o.meandec), \n    o.firstmjd\n\nFROM object o, catalog c\n    -- It is REALLY important to first use the catalog then the object ra,dec for speed. The radius is in degrees.\nWHERE\n    q3c_join(c.ra, c.dec, o.meanra, o.meandec, {radius})\n\'\'\'\n```\nIn this example, we also return the distance between matching objects \nusing the q3c_dist function, as well as other properties from the object table. \nIt is very important that the radius variable should be in degrees. In this example, the values variable should \ncorrespond to the list of coordinates using the following format, e.g. \n\'(id1,ra1,dec1),\\n(id2,ra2,dec2)\\n\', e.g., \'(ZTF24aabbcc,120.345677,-30.45774)\\n,(ZTF24aabbcd,65.346829,12.73474)\\n\'.\n\nIf the external catalog ids and coordinates are in a dataframe with column names id_source, ra, and dec, respectively, you could use the following code to get this formatted list:\n```python\n# starting with a dataframe df with the columns id_source, ra and dec, get the formatted list of coordinates ready for SQL\nobjects = []\nfor _,row in df.iterrows():\n    objects.append(f""(\\\'{row.id_source}\\\', {row.ra}, {row.dec})"")\nobjects_str = "",\\n"".join(objects)\n```\nFinally, remember that the table object does not have the ra and dec of every detection, only their mean values, so we used the meanra and meandec variables in the example above.\n\n\n## Important details about the database required for the query:\n## Default Parameters to Consider\n- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to\n  least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the \'ranking\' \n  column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification.

Favour using \nnested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.\n- Note that the typical timeout time is 2 minutes\n- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table, which, if possible, \nshould be avoided. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the \ncolumn \'name\' and its value for a given object in the column \'value\'. These \ncolumns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of \na nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed \nvariables.\n\n## ALeRCE Pipeline Details\n- Stamp Classifier (denoted as """"stamp_classifier""""): A convolutional neural \n  network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses \n  a 5 class taxonomy.

Hence, the most probable class should have \'ranking\'=1.\n- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light \n  Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical \n  classification. If no classifier is specified, use \n  \'classifier_name=""""lc_classifier""""\' when selecting probabilities.\n- If the user doesn\'t specify explicit columns, use the ""SELECT"" SQL statement \nto choose all possible columns.\n- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.\n- Use the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, \'SNIa\'.\n\n# Answer ONLY with a SQL query, with the following format: \n```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\n\nDON\'T include anything else in your answer.', 'Self-correction': '\nAs a SQL expert with a willingness to assist users, you are tasked with crafting a PostgreSQL query for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Database in 2023.
