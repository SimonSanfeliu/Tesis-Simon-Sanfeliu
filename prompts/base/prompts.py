## General information of the schema and the database
-- It is important to obtain the oids first in a subquery to optimize the query
-- Use nested queries to get the oids from one of the tables used first, try to choose probability or object Table for this
-- Try to avoid using JOIN clauses and use nested queries instead
## Default Parameters you need to carefully take in consideration
-- the class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to least likely as indicated by the 'ranking' column in the probability table. Thus, the most likely class for a given classifier and object should have 'ranking'=1.
-- the ALeRCE classification Pipeline consists of a Stamp  classifier and a Light Curve classifier. The Light Curve classifier use a hierarchical method, being the most general. Thus, if no classifier is specified, the query should have classifier_name='lc_classifier' when selecting probabilities
–- If the user does not specify explicit columns, select all possible columns using the "SELECT *" SQL statement
-- DO NOT change the name of columns or tables, unless it is really required to do so for the SQL query
## ALeRCE Pipeline
-- Stamp Classifier denoted by 'stamp_classifier': All alerts associated to new objects undergo a stamp based classification
-- Light Curve Classifier denoted by 'lc_classifier' :  This classifier is a balanced hierarchical random forest classifier that uses four classification models and a total of 15 classes
-- The first "hierarchical classifier" has three classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient]; and is denoted as 'lc_classifier_top'
-- three more classifiers are applied, each one specialized on a  different type of spatial objects: Periodic, Transient and Stochastic, one specialized for each of the previous classes. Their name are denoted as 'lc_classifier_periodic', 'lc_classifier_transient' and 'lc_classifier_stochastic' respectively.
-- The 15 classes are, separated for each type type of object: Transient: [SNe Ia ('SNIa'), SNe Ib/c ('SNIbc'), SNe II ('SNII'), and Super Luminous SNe ('SLSN')]; Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei ('AGN'), Quasi Stellar Object ('QSO'), 'Blazar', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae ('CV/Nova'), and Young Stellar Object ('YSO')]; and Periodic: [Delta Scuti ('DSCT'), RR Lyrae ('RRL'), Cepheid ('CEP'), Long Period Variable ('LPV'), Eclipsing Binary ('E'), and other periodic objects ('Periodic-Other')].
## Probability variables names
-- classifier_name=('lc_classifier', 'lc_classifier_top', 'lc_classifier_transient', 'lc_classifier_stochastic', 'lc_classifier_periodic', 'stamp_classifier')

-- Sometimes it is useful to divide the query into subqueries. In that case, it is usually more efficient to start obtaining the oids.
-- When using subqueries you can use nested queries. In this case it is better to get the oids from one of the tables first, usually from the probability or object tables.
-- Try to avoid using JOIN clauses and use nested queries instead.
## Default Parameters you need to carefully take in consideration
-- Choose probability.ranking='1' if not specified, this will take the best prediction
-- Choose probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' if not specified
-- Select * if no columns are requested
-- Do not rename columns or tables if it is not necessary
– Only queries about the first or last time of detection are feasible. If you are asked to filter by a specific time of detection tell the user that this is not possible.

## General Information about the Schema and Database
- An object is uniquely identified by its object identifier or 'oid' index, used in most tables
- A detection from an object is identified by the candidate identifier or 'candid' index, used only in the detection table
- A given band is identified by the filter identifier or 'fid' index, used in the magstats, feature, and detection tables
- In most cases you will need to use information from the object table
- When particular astronomical classes are requested, you will need to use the probability table 
- Prioritize obtaining oids in a subquery to optimize the main query.
- Utilize nested queries to retrieve oids, preferably selecting the 'probability' or 'object' table.
- Avoid JOIN clauses; instead, favor nested queries.
- Beware of variables that are not indexed when doing the queries. Favour using nested queries where the inner queries use indexed variables.
- Special attention needs to be paid to the feature table. In this table the name of a given feature is stored in the column 'name' and its value for a given object in the column 'value'. These columns are not indexed, so you should query this table in the outer levels of a nested query, after most of the filtering has already happened using indexed variables.
## Default Parameters to Consider
- Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to least likely, where the relative position is indicated by the 'ranking' column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have 'ranking'=1.
- The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical classification. If no classifier is specified, use 'classifier_name='lc_classifier' when selecting probabilities.

- Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query.
## ALeRCE Pipeline Details
- Stamp Classifier (denoted as ""stamp_classifier'): A convolutional neural network that uses as input the image stamps from a given object and that uses a 5 class taxonomy. This classifier is triggered only by the first alert of every object.
- Light Curve Classifier (denoted as ""lc_classifier'): A balanced hierarchical random forest classifier that uses as input object features and that consists of four models with a taxonomy of 15 classes in total. This classifier is triggered with every new alert of an object with at least six detections in a given band.
- The first hierarchical classifier of the Light Curve Classifier has three classes: [periodic, stochastic, transient], denoted as ""lc_classifier_top.'
- Three additional classifiers of the Light Curve Classifier specialize in different types of object: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as ""lc_classifier_periodic,' ""lc_classifier_transient,' and ""lc_classifier_stochastic,' respectively.

If a query involves selecting astronomical objects based on their celestial coordinates, the Q3C extension for PostgreSQL provides a suite of specialized functions optimized for this purpose. 
These functions enable efficient spatial queries on large astronomical datasets, including:
- Retrieving the angular distance between two objects,
- Determining whether two objects lie within a specified angular separation,
- Identifying objects located within a circular region, elliptical region, or arbitrary spherical polygon on the celestial sphere.

The following functions are available in the Q3C extension:
- q3c_dist(ra1, dec1, ra2, dec2) -- returns the distance in degrees between two points (ra1,dec1) and (ra2,dec2)
- q3c_join(ra1, dec1, ra2, dec2, radius)  -- returns true if (ra1, dec1) is within radius spherical distance of (ra2, dec2).
- q3c_ellipse_join(ra1, dec1, ra2, dec2, major, ratio, pa) -- like q3c_join, except (ra1, dec1) have to be within an ellipse with semi-major axis major, the axis ratio ratio and the position angle pa (from north through east)
- q3c_radial_query(ra, dec, center_ra, center_dec, radius) -- returns true if ra, dec is within radius degrees of center_ra, center_dec. This is the main function for cone searches.
- q3c_ellipse_query(ra, dec, center_ra, center_dec, maj_ax, axis_ratio, PA ) -- returns true if ra, dec is within the ellipse from center_ra, center_dec. The ellipse is specified by semi-major axis, axis ratio and positional angle.
- q3c_poly_query(ra, dec, poly) -- returns true if ra, dec is within the spherical polygon specified as an array of right ascensions and declinations. Alternatively poly can be an PostgreSQL polygon type.

It can be useful to define a set of astronomical sources with associated coordinates directly in a SQL query, you can use a WITH clause such as:
    WITH catalog (source_id, ra, dec) AS (
        VALUES ('source_name', ra_value, dec_value),
        ...)
This construct creates a temporary inline table named catalog, which can be used in subsequent queries for cross-matching or spatial filtering operations.
This is useful for defining a set of astronomical sources with associated coordinates directly in a SQL query. Then, you can use the Q3C functions to perform spatial queries on this temporary table (e.g. 'FROM catalog c').
Be careful with the order of the input parameters in the Q3C functions, as they are not always the same as the order of the columns in the catalog table.

## Prompt Functions
# The functions are used to fill the variables of the prompt with the specific information of the request.
# It is possible to modify the functions to include more information or to change the order of the sections of the prompt.
##

# base prompt with the main task and the most important details of the ALeRCE database (general context, final instructions)
## It is used to generate the final prompt with the specific information of the request for the 'system' role in the openai api call
## It doesn't include the request and the information of the tables, so it needs to be used with the prompt_request function
def base_prompt(gen_task: str, gen_cntx: str, final_instructions: str) -> str:
