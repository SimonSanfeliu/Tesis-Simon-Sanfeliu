    REQUEST: Query objects which appeared between august 25 and september 10 of 2022, which are classified as supernova by the stamp classifier with a probability greater than 0.5 or which have more than one detection
    Let's Think Step By Step. The user is asking for general information about objects between two specific dates, information that is in the object table. Also, the user is asking for objects classified by supernova with a specific probability, so we need to use the probability table. 
    Finally, the user is asking for objects with more than one detection, so we can use the object table again to add this condition with an OR statement from the requested probability.

-- mjd represents the Observation Modified Julian date at start of exposure [days]
-- fid represents the Filter ID (1=g; 2=r; 3=i)
-- magpsf represents the magnitude from PSF-fit photometry [mag]
    REQUEST: Given the next list of oids ['ZTF21aaqosfj' 'ZTF21aaqoski' 'ZTF21aaqoskz' 'ZTF21aaqosly' 'ZTF21aaqosmj' 'ZTF21aaqosmi' 'ZTF21aaqosmk' 'ZTF21aaqosmm' 'ZTF21aaqosmp' 'ZTF21aaqosmq'], give a query that returns the magnitudes of their detections, with their oids, candidate identifiers, the date of exposure and the filter id.
    ANSWER:
     
SELECT oid, candid, mjd, fid, magpsf
FROM detection
WHERE
oid in ('ZTF21aaqosfj','ZTF21aaqoski','ZTF21aaqoskz','ZTF21aaqosly','ZTF21aaqosmj','ZTF21aaqosmi','ZTF21aaqosmk','ZTF21aaqosmm','ZTF21aaqosmp','ZTF21aaqosmq')
