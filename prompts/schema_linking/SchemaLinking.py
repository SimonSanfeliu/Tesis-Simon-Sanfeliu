### Schema Linking Task Prompts
# This file contains the prompts for the Schema Linking task.
# With Schema linking, the model is expected to identify the tables and columns needed to answer a question.
# The main prompt for the Schema Linking task is composed by a short general description of the task, followed by a detailed description of the tables and columns in the database.
# The structure of the prompt can be modified to include more information or to change the order of the sections using the prompt functions.
###

# Final instructions for the Schema Linking task, to emphasize the importance of providing only the tables needed to answer a question in a specific format.
## Version 1
sl_final_instructions_v1 = '''
# Give ONLY the TABLES that are needed to generate the SQL query, nothing more
# Give the answer in the following format: ['table1', 'table2', ...]
# For example, if the TABLES needed for the user request are TABLE object and TABLE taxonomy, then you should type: ['object', 'taxonomy']
# Remember to use the exact name of the TABLES, as they are written in the DATABASE SCHEMA
# Just give the tables and ignore any other task given in the request given as "request".
'''
## Version 2
sl_final_instructions_v2 = '''
# Information about the database
## Table object is the main table, so any request that ask for information about the object, will need this table.
## Table probability is the only table that has information of the classifications, so any request that ask for probabilities, any classifier, or somespecific object type (for example Supernovaes (SNe), 'SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN', 'QSO', 'AGN', 'Blazar', 'CV/Nova', 'YSO', 'LPV', 'E', 'DSCT', 'RRL', 'CEP', 'Periodic-Other'), will need this table.
## Table feature is the only table that has information of the features used for the classification, so any request that ask for features, will need this table.

# Give ONLY the TABLES that are needed to generate the SQL query.
# Give the answer in the following format: ['table1', 'table2', 'table3', ...]. For example, if the TABLES needed for the user request are TABLE object and TABLE taxonomy, then you should type: ['object', 'taxonomy']
# Just give the tables and ignore any other task given in the request given as "request".
# Remember to use the exact name of the TABLES, as they are written in the DATABASE SCHEMA. Do NOT create table names.
'''
## Version 3
sl_final_instructions_v3 = '''
# Give ONLY the TABLES that are needed to generate the SQL query.
# Give the answer in the following format: ['table1', 'table2', 'table3', ...]. For example, if the TABLES needed for the user request are TABLE object and TABLE taxonomy, then you should type: ['object', 'taxonomy']
# Just give the tables and ignore any other task given in the request given as "request".
# Remember to use the exact name of the TABLES, as they are written in the DATABASE SCHEMA. Do NOT create table names.
# If you think that no table mentioned above is needed, then type: ""

## Version 1

## Version 3

## Version 4

## It is necessary only if it asks for information about the object, for example, if it asks for a specific number of detections, the number of observations, the times of first and last detection, etc.
## If the user does not ask for information in the Table (check the columns), then the table is not needed.
